## Plugin installation

Follow the instruction below if you want to install Lengow for Magento using Git.

1.) Clone the git repository to the desired location using:

    git clone git@github.com:lengow/plugin-magento.git Lengow_Export

In case you wish to contribute to the plugin, fork the `dev` branch rather than cloning it, and create a pull request via Github. For further information please read the section "Become a contributor" of this document.

2.) Set the correct directory permissions:

    chmod -R 755 Lengow_Export

Depending on your server configuration, it might be necessary to set whole write permissions (777) to the files and folders above.
You can also start testing with lower permissions due to security reasons (644 for example) as long as your php process can write to those files.

3.) Run the install script in `tools` folder to creates symbolic links to the sources of the plugin:
    
    sh install.sh magento_install_path
    
`magento_install_path` represents the path to the root folder of your Magento installation (folder containing the app, skin, var ... folders).

4.) Activate the option 'symlinks' in the Magento configuration (Configuration > Advanced > Developer > Template Settings Allow Simlinks => Yes).

Warning ! On the latest 1.9 versions of Magento, this option was removed for security reasons. Connect to your database and play the following SQL query:

    INSERT INTO core_config_data (config_id, scope, scope_id, path, value) VALUES (NULL , 'default', '0', 'dev/template/allow_symlink', '1');

5.) Go to "System" > "Cache Management" and click both the "Flush Magento Cache" as well as the "Flush Cache Storage" button.

6.) Log out, then log back in on the Magento back-office.

4.) Log in with your Lengow credentials and configure the plugin.
